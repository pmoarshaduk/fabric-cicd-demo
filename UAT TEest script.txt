Test Scenario Request: CI/CD Flow for File Deployment to PROD

I'd like to run a complete test case to validate the CI/CD pipeline. Here's what I want to do:

Test File: I have a file named sales_data1.csv.

Target Location: I want to place this file in my local development folder. Please confirm the correct path to my repo folder.

CI/CD Flow: I want to follow the full CI/CD process step by step to:

Load this file into the Fabric workspace

Validate its deployment through the pipeline

Publish it to the PROD environment

Validation: Let me know if any steps are missing or unclear in this flow.

Confirmation: Do you understand what Iâ€™m trying to test with this scenario?
